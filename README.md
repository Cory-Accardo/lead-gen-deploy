This is a recoded (the original version was in python's Django framework) version of my interactive lead generator system. This was the first fullstack coding project I ever built (May 2019)

Unfortunately, due to Yelp updating their UI, the web scraping algorithm is now depreciated and the deep-search no longer works.

However, it initially was designed to be used to help aggregate website, facebook, and other useful urls, which could then be further scraped for more data and saved to an excel spreadsheet. I quickly got overwhelmed by CS assignments, so I dropped the project.
